This is an experiment in which passive sensory movements are used to cause a proprioceptive displacement, and then we ask whether this affects adaptation.

This is built for the inmotion2 robot.


# Usage

Clone the robot repository (https://github.com/florisvanvugt/inmotionpy) and place its  subdirectory `robot` into the present repository.

Run `screencalib.py` to ensure the mapping between robot positions and the screen is accurate.

`make`




# Control flow within the experiment

Every block starts in `init`.

  * Passive trials `init -> return -> forward -> backward`
  * Pinpoint trials `init -> return -> `
  * Active trials `init -> return > `




# TODO
- [ ] Robot binary log
- [ ] Record handle forces
- [ ] Record trial # in log
- [ ] Joystick positioning: random offset at every trial

- [ ] Could "cache" the selector arc surface and then blit it
